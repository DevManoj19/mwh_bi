        "# Complementary Resolution Processes:\n",
        "# - A user or system encountering a `did:doi:<DOI_value>` can first resolve the DID to get the DID Document.\n",
        "# - The DID Document can provide:\n",
        "#   - Verification methods to cryptographically verify claims or data integrity proofs related to the digital object identified by the DOI. For example, verifying a signature on a dataset or checking the hash of a file.\n",
        "#   - Service endpoints that might point back to the Dataverse landing page (resolvable via the DOI) or specific APIs for accessing the data or metadata in a machine-readable format.\n",
        "# - Simultaneously, the DOI itself can be resolved using standard DOI resolution services (e.g., doi.org) to reach the human-readable landing page provided by Dataverse.\n",
        "# - The two resolution processes complement each other:\n",
        "#   - DID resolution provides the decentralized identity layer, enabling verification and linking to decentralized services.\n",
        "#   - DOI/Handle resolution provides access to the traditional web-based representation and metadata of the digital object within the established data repository (Dataverse).\n",
        "# - A system could use the DID to verify the integrity or authenticity of the data and then use the DOI/Handle (either extracted from the DID string or found in the DID Document) to access the data through the familiar Dataverse interface.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 5. Briefly discussing potential methods or registries for mapping DOIs/Handles to DIDs if direct incorporation into the DID string is not chosen.\n",
        "# If Method 2 from point 1 is chosen (DOI/Handle in DID Document, not DID string), or if a separate mapping is desired even with Method 1, a mapping registry or service is needed.\n",
        "# Potential methods/registries:\n",
        "# - A dedicated mapping registry: A centralized or decentralized database that stores pairs of (DOI/Handle, DID). This registry would need to be maintained and queried to find the DID for a given DOI/Handle or vice-versa.\n",
        "# - Storing the mapping on a decentralized ledger: A custom smart contract or ledger application could store the mapping, allowing for decentralized lookup.\n",
        "# - Including the DID in the Dataverse metadata: As discussed in the previous subtask (Option A), Dataverse itself could store the associated DID in a dedicated metadata field, effectively acting as a mapping service for its own content. This requires Dataverse schema modification.\n",
        "# - Including the DOI/Handle in the DID Document (Method 2): While not a separate registry, the DID Document itself acts as the link, requiring resolution of the DID to find the associated DOI/Handle.\n",
        "\n",
        "# The choice of mapping method depends on factors like decentralization requirements, ease of implementation, and reliance on existing infrastructure. Including the DOI/Handle directly in the DID string (`did:doi`/`did:handle`) is a form of decentralized mapping inherent in the DID method design."

        "1.  **Identify the Object's DID:** Obtain the unique DID assigned to the cultural heritage object (e.g., `did:dataverse:doi:10.7910/DVN/TJCLKP`). In a real system, this DID might be found on a physical object via a QR code, in a digital catalog, or provided by a system. In the prototype concept, you would conceptually have this DID available.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Initiate DID Resolution:** Conceptually use the Simulated DID Resolver function with the object's DID as input.\n",
        "    *   *Conceptual Action:* Call `resolve_did(\"did:dataverse:doi:...\")`.\n",
        "    *   *Conceptual Outcome:* The resolver looks up and returns the Simplified DID Document associated with that DID from the simulated store.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Access Conceptual Dataverse Metadata:** From the resolved Simplified DID Document, extract the conceptual Dataverse identifier (DOI/Handle) and the conceptual service endpoint. Use this identifier to conceptually access the base metadata.\n",
        "    *   *Conceptual Action:* Extract DOI/Handle from the DID Document and call `access_dataverse_metadata(\"doi:10.7910/DVN/...\")`.\n",
        "    *   *Conceptual Outcome:* The function returns simulated base metadata for the object.\n",
        "\n",

        "    *   *Conceptual Action:* Examine the DID Document for links to decentralized enriched metadata.\n",

This action would be conceptually linked to the user's DID via a simplified Verifiable Credential concept.\n",
        "    *   *Conceptual Action:* Imagine a user with DID `did:example:user123` providing feedback or verification on the enriched metadata.\n",
